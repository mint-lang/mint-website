            Mint and Gleam are both statically typed functional programming languages, but they
            differ in focus and ecosystems. Mint is tailored specifically for building front-end
            web applications, offering built-in support for styling, UI components, and a
            JavaScript-only target. Gleam, while also capable of front-end development through
            its JavaScript backend, is primarily designed for reliability and concurrency, with
            strong support for backend systems via the Erlang VM. Gleam emphasizes simplicity,
            speed, and type safety across both back- and front-end, whereas Mint provides a more
            integrated front-end developer experience with features like promises and CSS handling
            built into the language.
